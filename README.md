3. **Create Classes for Data Transfer Objects (DTOs)**
   - Define Data Transfer Objects to represent data exchanged between the Web API and Blazor components.

4. **Create ProductRepository Class (Repository Design Pattern)**
   - Implement the repository design pattern to manage interactions with the database.

5. **Create ProductController Class**
   - Develop a controller to handle product-related operations in the Web API.

6. **Create DtoConversion Class (DTO Conversion Extension methods)**
